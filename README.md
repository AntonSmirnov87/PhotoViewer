# PhotoViewer
Creates a simple and clean way of displaying photos in a responsive and mobile-friendly way.

To initialize, tag your thumbnail images with a "PhotoViewer" class and then run the 'initPhotoViewer()' JS function on page load.

You can scroll through a gallery of photos if the thumbnails are placed in a DIV with class "PhotoGallery", which can be automated with the CreateGallery PHP function.
